Linear Search:

Linear search is a simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in the list until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.
It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
In the worst-case scenario, linear search may need to iterate through all elements in the list, making it inefficient for large datasets.
Linear search is suitable for unordered lists or when the position of the target element is unknown.
Binary Search:

Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm that requires the list to be sorted.
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found.
Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
The logarithmic time complexity of binary search makes it significantly faster than linear search for large datasets.
However, binary search requires the list to be sorted, which may add an extra preprocessing step if the list is not already sorted.
