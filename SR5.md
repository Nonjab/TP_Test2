Performance:
Linear Search:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Linear search iterates through the entire dataset sequentially until it finds the target element or reaches the end. It performs well on small datasets but becomes inefficient on large datasets due to its linear time complexity.
Binary Search:

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Binary search requires the dataset to be sorted. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target element is found. It is highly efficient on large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
Comparison:
Speed:

Binary search is generally faster than linear search, especially on large datasets, because it eliminates half of the remaining elements in each iteration.
Efficiency:

Linear search is simple to implement and works on unsorted datasets, but it can be slow on large datasets.
Binary search is more efficient but requires the dataset to be sorted initially. It performs significantly better on large datasets.
Use Cases:

Linear search is suitable for small datasets or when the dataset is unsorted.
Binary search is ideal for large sorted datasets where efficiency is crucial.
